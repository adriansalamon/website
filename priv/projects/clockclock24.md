ClockClock 24 is a digital clock consisting of 24 analog clocks. The original
version was created by Humans Since 1982. All rights to the original design
belong to Humans Since 1982.

I created my own version of the clock as a hobby project. This project involved
designing a circuit, constructing a custom PCB, designing and manufacturing the
frame, including some 3D-printed parts, and writing the firmware. I will be writing
a more comprehensive blog post about this project in the future, so stay tuned.

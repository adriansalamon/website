ClockClock 24 is a digital clock consisting of 24 analog clocks. The original
version was created by Humans Since 1982. All rights to the original design
belong to Humans Since 1982.

I created my own version of the clock as a hobby project. This project involved
designing a circuit, constructing a custom PCB, designing and manufacturing the
frame, including some 3D-printed parts, and writing the firmware. I wrote a more
comprehensive [blog post](/output/posts/2023/06-22-building-a-clock-clock-24-replica)
about the project.

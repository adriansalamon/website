Reinforcement learning driven TabuCol (RLTCol) was my bachelor's thesis project.
We developed the RLTCol algorithm, which is a hybrid heuristic algorithm for the
graph coloring problem that uses reinforcement learning. We found that RLTCol
performed better than the TabuCol algorithm, which it is based on, on the DIMACS
benchmark instances. The code is open source and can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/adriansalamon/RLTCol).

Haj is a platform for METAspexet written in Elixir. METAspexet is an annual
student musical theatre production that is put on by Computer Science and Media
Technology students at KTH. Each year, a team of around 130 students work
together voluntarily to create a show that is performed at a commercial theatre.

I am the creator and lead developer of the internal platform Haj, which aims to
make organizing the project easier. The platform makes it easy to manage and
keep track of the members of different groups, selling merchandise, keeping an
archive of previous shows, and keeping track of responsibilities within the
organization. Haj is written in Elixir and uses the Phoenix framework with
Phoenix LiveView. The code is open source and can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/datasektionen/haj).

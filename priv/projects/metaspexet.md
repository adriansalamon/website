METAspexet is an annual student musical theatre production that is put on by
Computer Science and Media Technology students at KTH. Each year, a team of
around 130 students work together voluntarily to create a show that is performed
at a commercial theatre. I designed and developed the website. The website is
built in Elixir using the Phoenix framework and is designed using Tailwind CSS.

## Wow

A markdown post without any problems whatsoever, this did not at all take like an hour to write :sligtly_smiling:


# More

Let's try some more stuff, like a list:

- One
- Two
- Three

And some code:

```elixir
defmodule Website.Application do
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      {Bandit, plug: Website.Endpoint},
      {Website.LiveReload.Watcher, dirs: ["lib/", "assets/*"], name: :live_reload_watcher}
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: Website.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```
